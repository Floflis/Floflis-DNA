- move 'dna_ascii' to a resources folder
- symlink DISCLAIMER and other similar files to upper layers (check CID before)

- store distrobase

- don't install lightdm and others if Ubuntu

Last step of Floflis install is to run install-custom.sh, that constains UniOS install

Issue: even not completing install, it considers the latest layer (to fix that, Floflis DNA should only load layers' installers if previous are installed. previous are only registered as installed after steps are identified as completed)

modules as folders with git and their oppose versions (uses git branches)

DNA install.sh only install next layers if previous are installed
DNA install.sh ask to keep git folder when installing

fix: it recognizes is Linux, but shows unknw
fix: isnt reading distro name, showing unknw

itself and installer: use SH
